# The-Neighbor
A Django application that lets a user create or join a neighborhood and post update to stay in the loop on things happening in the neighborhood.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes, 
1. **Clone** this repository to your machine

2. Create a **virtual environment** 
   ```
   python3 -m venv virtual

   source virtual/bin/activate
   ```
   or 
   ```
   pipenv shell
   ```
3. Install project **dependencies**
   ```sh
    (virtual) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Using pipenv will automatically install the dependecies from either requirements.txt or pipfile upon creating the environment.
* See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
